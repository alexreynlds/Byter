# Byter

Byter is a game that I created as part of my final year university dissertation.

Created in the Unity engine, the game is a simplistic pixel art dungeon crawler, similar to that of "The Binding of Isaac." and as per my dissertation, included an implementation of dynamic difficiulty, in that when starting a game you can choose between fixed or dynamic, wherein the game will get harder/easier depending on how well you're doing.

The game contains randomly generated dungeons, powerups, multiple enemies and bosses.

More info, including download links for both windows and mac can be found on my website here: https://www.alexreynolds.dev/portfolio/byter

And I really hope to come back to this project one day and polish it up.
